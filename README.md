You can add your category easily. Just add a .csv file in the csv folder. The script will automatically add it to the interface. Each entry must be on a different line in the .csv file. The file name must have a specific format, e.g. x_xnameoffile.csv. The x are numbers which will determine the display order in the prompt (alphabetical order).
